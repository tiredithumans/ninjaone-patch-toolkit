# Ship — commit → push → PR → merge → cleanup

Land the current changes on `main` using this repo's exact flow, end to end, without stopping to
ask between steps. If arguments were passed, treat them as guidance (what to include, scope hint,
or PR title). Stop and ask only if the working tree mixes clearly unrelated work and the split is
ambiguous, or if a gate fails.

## 0. Preflight

- `git status --short` and `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`. Nothing to commit **and**
  nothing unpushed → report "nothing to ship" and stop.
- **Gate check:** if any Rust/WASM source changed (`src-tauri/`, `web-rs/`), run `just verify`
  and stop on failure. Changes limited to docs, `.claude/`, or `.github/` skip verify — say so in
  the PR test plan. Merging here does not wait on remote checks, so the local gates are the only
  gates.

## 1. Branch

- On `main`? Create `git checkout -b <type>/<short-slug>`, where `<type>` matches the dominant
  conventional-commit type (`feat`/`fix`/`docs`/`chore`/`refactor`/…). Already on a topic branch?
  Stay on it.

## 2. Commit

- Group the changes into one or more **logical** commits — one concern per commit — each following
  Conventional Commits (AGENTS.md → Git & version control). Pass multi-line bodies with the
  `-m "$(cat <<'EOF' … EOF)"` heredoc form; the commit-validator hook understands it, including
  double quotes inside the body.
- Stage explicitly (`git add <paths>`), never a blind `git add -A` — leave unrelated files behind.

## 3. Push + PR

- `git push -u origin <branch>`
- `gh pr create --base main --title "<conventional subject>" --body …` — body is `## Summary`
  (what + why, bulleted) and `## Test plan` (checkboxes for what was *actually* run; an unchecked
  box is better than a false one).

## 4. Merge + cleanup

- `gh pr merge <num> --merge --delete-branch` — this repo uses merge commits. The command also
  checks out `main`, fast-forwards it, and deletes the local branch.
- `git fetch --prune` to drop the stale remote-tracking ref it leaves behind.
- Confirm `git status` is clean on the updated `main`, then report the PR URL and merge commit.

## Failure handling

- Commit blocked by the validator hook → fix the message; never bypass with `--no-verify`.
- `just verify` fails → stop, report the failing gate's output, do not push.
- PR not mergeable (conflict, branch protection) → stop and report; never force-push or merge with
  admin overrides.
